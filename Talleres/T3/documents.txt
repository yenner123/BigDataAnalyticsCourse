{"0": "bahia cocoa review showers continued throughout the week in the bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early january and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, comissaria smith said in its weekly review. the dry period means the temporao will be late this year. arrivals for the week ended february 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. comissaria smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. with total bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. there are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +bahia superior+ certificates. in view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. comissaria smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for march shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. new crop sales were also light and all to open ports with june/july going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under new york july, aug/sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne fob. routine sales of butter were made. march/april sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. april/may butter went at 2.27 times new york may, june/july at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, aug/sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times new york sept and oct/dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times new york dec, comissaria smith said. destinations were the u.s., covertible currency areas, uruguay and open ports. cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for march/april, 785 dlrs for may, 753 dlrs for aug and 0.39 times new york dec for oct/dec. buyers were the u.s., argentina, uruguay and convertible currency areas. liquor sales were limited with march/april selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, june/july at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times new york july, aug/sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times new york sept and oct/dec at 1.25 times new york dec, comissaria smith said. total bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop. final figures for the period to february 28 are expected to be published by the brazilian cocoa trade commission after

act quickly on its proposed equity offering and would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor performance, banking analysts said. some analysts said they have recommended bankamerica delay its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be approved by the securities and exchange commission. bankamerica stock fell this week, along with other banking issues, on the news that brazil has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt. the stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon, after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news. banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the first interstate bancorp <i> takeover bid gone, bankamerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term. bankamerica filed the offer on january 26. it was seen as one of the major factors leading the first interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on february 9. a bankamerica

bankamerica's vice president for financial communications, when asked if bankamerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives sec approval. \"i'd put it off as long as they

outlook. although bankamerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it. such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to bankamerica stock holders, noted daniel williams, analyst with sutro group. several analysts said that while they believe the brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks. nevertheless, bankamerica, which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln dlrs if brazil pays no interest for a year, said joseph arsenio, analyst with birr, wilson and co. he noted, however, that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter. with other major banks standing to lose even more than bankamerica if brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks. reuter ", "4":

pct over eurodollar rates, but venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year. it also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987, 1988 and

deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in washington, political analysts said. \"this is certification of incompetence,\" private political analyst stephen hess told reuters in commenting on the tower report made public today. \"it's as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials.\" in one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman john tower, a longtime reagan supporter and former republican senator from texas, told a press conference, \"the president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation.\" the report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in washington that reagan is not in full command of the government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the republican president's own choosing. the three-member panel made up of tower, former national security adviser brent scowcroft and former secretary of state edmund muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a congress controlled by the democratic party. \"we're falling by our own hand,\" said one republican political strategist. \"what can we say except 'we're sorry, we won't do it again'?\" the strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said the report was like \"an anvil falling on us.\" hess, with the brookings institution public policy study group, said the report is the final blow to reagan's hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with congress, the press and the washington bureaucracy. the report may also undermine the standing of defense secretary caspar weinberger and secretary of state george shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president. \"they protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. they were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences,\" it said. white house chief of staff donald regan and former central intelligence agency director william casey also received strong criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases. regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged for allegedly failing both to help reagan conduct the iran initiative and to avoid \"chaos\" in the disclosure process. casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in december, had already resigned for health reasons last month. \"this is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes,\" tower told reporters. while reagan retains considerable constitutional powers, including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly with congress controlled by the democrats. the crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the man in the street will forsake reagan over the affair. although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with iran became public last november, his personal popularity is still relatively high. a los angeles times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought reagan was in control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president. american enterprise institute analyst william schneider, a democrat, says reagan's loss of support among washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public. \"in the past, he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public,\" schneider said. reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week. but one top republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround. \"the white house has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met,\" said the strategist, who requested anonymity. \"they have to recognize there is no quick fix.\" analysts also point out that reagan's personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies. they note he was dramatically rebuffed in last november's elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control of the senate to the democrats. reuter ", "28": "january housing sales drop, realty group says

presage lackluster real growth in the u.s. economy in the first quarter of 1987, economists said. with total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector, falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report painted a bleak picture for the u.s. economy. but they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital investment. \"it's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said david wyss of data resources inc. \"i'm particularly impressed by the 19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to tax reform than we thought.\" the commerce department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in office and computing equipment orders. economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws. \"it's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so people just aren't doing it as much,\" wyss said. increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws, economists said. november durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and december's increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported 0.9 pct. but most acknowledged that the huge january drop was caused by more than tax reform. \"the wash-out that took place in january was far greater than the actual gains that took place in november and december,\" said bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc. \"the economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year.\" \"the report definitely points to very sluggish capital spending over the next couple of quarters,\" said donald maude of midland montagu capital markets inc. maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. in november, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in december they fell 0.6 pct and in january 0.7 pct, he said. \"it suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which may quickly translate to a drop in production,\" midland montagu's maude said. wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of january's report, given that other reports have reflected strength. but he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51 pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in december. he also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in january shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in december. \"given these numbers, there's no reason for the fed to tighten,\" data resources' wyss said. \"but there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers like this. the fed will wait and

77 there was a tremendous shortage of newsprint. there were days when we didn't have enough paper to print the paper,\" peladeau said. \"when i lived that, i said to myself...next time we'll be ready.\" peladeau said most of donohue's current total newsprint capacity however, is already committed to other buyers. quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year and maxwell's company, which publishes britain's daily mirror newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes. peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49 pct owned by the new york times, (nyt.a), adding to donohue's 540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will have to install another paper machine at amos, quebec, or build another mill to meet their demands . he said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be on stream in two years. he said a mill in matane, a depressed area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the government. peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures with maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in france or in the u.s., where the company owns two large printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire. he said maxwell's sons, who are french citizens, would provide an entree into the french market, where foreigners are prevented from buying newspapers. peladeau said he would consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in france or the u.s. quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of two groups of weekly newspapers in the u.s., and is negotiating the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in canada, peladeau said. he said the company may consider starting daily newspapers in two small quebec cities and buying radio stations in the province. peladeau said quebecor may also consider trading in its listing on the american stock exchange for a new york stock exchange listing. reuter ", "79": "new york business loans fall 195 mln dlrs commercial and industrial loans on the books of the 10 major new york banks, excluding

some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock. american express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the market calculated a partially public shearson may command a good market value, thereby boosting the total value of american express. the rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. american express closed on the new york stock exchange at 72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. american express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity. analysts said comments by the company at an analysts' meeting tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes. at the meeting, company officials said american express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of shearson, according to analysts. yesterday, shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer, jeffery lane, to the added position of president, which had been vacant. it also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions. analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff. some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for american express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year. \"i think it is highly unlikely that american express is going to sell shearson,\" said perrin long of lipper analytical. he questioned what would be a better investment than \"a very profitable securities firm.\" several analysts said american express is not in need of cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset. but others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of shearson, and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. larry eckenfelder of prudential-bache securities said he believes american express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past. \"shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. shearson's book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization,\" said eckenfelder. some analysts said american express could use capital since it plans to expand globally. \"they have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. you want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road,\" said e.f. hutton group analyst michael lewis. \"they've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily in the future, which goes heavily

business by selling part of shearson, its stock might better reflect other assets, such as the travel related services business. \"it could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. the value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company,\" he said. lewis said shearson

department and the office of management and budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a gao official told reuters. gao is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of sen. jesse helms (r-n.c.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. the report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid march. the cost of certificates, said the gao source, depends on the program's impact on the usda loan program. if gao determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. however, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less. gao will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the gao official said. but a negative report on certificates \"will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh

foreign debt, finance minister manuel azpurua told a press conference. he declined to comment on meetings this week in new york between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's 13-bank advisory committee except to say, \"they are progressing.\" azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate according to its own interest. asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over libor, azpurua said only, \"that is good news.\" according to banking sources, the banks' latest offer to venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct venezuela wants. azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment schedule, and debt capitalization schemes. azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in public and private debt principal this year. it was due to amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420 mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector. he said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank loans. the banking sources said the committee has been prepared to lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that no direct commitment was likely on new loans. \"debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of financing is guaranteed,\" azpurua said. however, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt payments, \"because circumstances change too quickly.\" at the same time, he said the government is presently studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries. the rules would be published by the finance ministry and the central bank. reuter ",

farm credit law passed by congress, the fca, as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all its capital and needs federal government help. however, fca chairman frank naylor said because much of the system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action, he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year and perhaps not even in 1988. the other republican member of

for resale to investors. naylor and beesley said a secondary market set-up outside the farm credit system would hurt the system. but beesley said a secondary market with the farm credit system as its

staff donald regan could signal the death knell to his white house tenure, but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear. regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert arms sales to iran and diversion of profits to nicaraguan rebels first emerged last november. but criticism of the roles of secretary of state george shultz and defense secretary caspar weinberger, who said they opposed the iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been muted until the release of the tower commission report. \"their obligation was to give the president their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the president,\" the report said after a three-month probe. \"instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program. they protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. they were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages.\" the report saved some of its most scathing language for regan, a gruff former wall street executive and close personal friend of reagan whose autocratic rule in the white house angered some top reagan officials and, perhaps more importantly, reagan's wife nancy. \"more than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he asserted personal control over the white house staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser,\" said the report. washington analysts said regan's departure now appeared to be only a matter of timing. many expected the president to announce it when he addresses the nation on the tower commission's findings next week. with regan's departure apparently imminent and poindexter and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the report's tough criticism of shultz and weinberger could turn the spotlight on their future. senate republican leader robert dole, a key reagan ally, told reporters the report disclosed \"colossal blunders\" and said people who had not served the president well should step aside, but he did not specify who should go. \"it would seem to me that if you don't protect the president, you don't serve the president well, then you should move on,\" the kansas republican, a likely presidential candidate next year, said. one republican strategist said he believed regan would not be the only white house official to leave in the near future. reuter ", "178": "swiss economy in excellent condition, oecd says switzerland's economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the organisation for economic cooperation and development, oecd, said. this reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said. the oecd, in its annual report on switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern. the study forecast a decline in gross domestic product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985. but it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation oecd area. assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986. the faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to gdp would shrink in both years. but \"given switzerland's large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than gdp...which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances,\" the oecd said. real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted. in 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall gdp, it added. the outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said. as a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986. but the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange. the long-term appreciation of the swiss franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said. particularly for the banks, \"recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... to preserve its competitive position,\" it said. reuter ", "179": "u.s. wheat bonus to soviet called dormant the u.s. agriculture department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the soviet union under the export enhancement

companies are trying to get this fired up again,\" an aide to agriculture secretary richard lyng said. \"but there just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally.\" most analysts interviewed by

don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process,\" the aide to lyng said. \"an export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,\" said one former usda official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling china wheat under the subsidy program. an official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within usda might be nudged along by members of congress, a number of whom urged usda this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the soviets. but lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to capitol hill yesterday, house members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time. the administration's interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer moscow wheat under the eep, officials at the u.s. trade representative's office said. in their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration's previous eep offer but did not talk about any new initiative. one usda official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of \"calm, basic, factual economics.\" another usda official said there was \"not even an informal suggestion or hint\" that the soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms. usda and private sources agreed that consideration of an eep initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the white house stemming from the iran arms affair. reuter ", "180": "u.s. treasury part of argentine bridge loan the u.s. treasury said it was willing to participate with several other industrial countries in providing a 500

accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil. the weekly u.s. soybean crush rate was reported by the national soybean processors association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year. active soymeal export loadings at the gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number. however, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop south american soymeal over the next few months. u.s. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said. soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby march contract today. \"many speculators down here bought march soymeal and sold may, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause march to gain on deferreds),\" one cbt crush trader said. \"but they've been bailing out this week because the march has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month,\" he added. as a result of the weakness in soymeal, the march crush ratio (the value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days. the may crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added. with futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins. a central illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said. most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. but processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins,

degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. \"the numbers were a little disappointing, but i think we can take mr volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed,\" said bob bannon of security pacific national bank. fed chairman paul volcker told a congressional committee last thursday that the fed's policy \"has been unchanged up to today.\" although volcker's statement last thursday allayed most fears that the fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. this need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since april of last year, economists added. today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. \"the one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on wednesday,\" said dana johnson of first national bank of chicago. \"but there was a clearly justified need for them. there was nothing ominous.\" \"the fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. if it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections,\" added security pacific's bannon. a fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the fed's discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln. for the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. \"there were wire problems at two large banks on tuesday and wednesday, so i am not too bothered about the borrowings,\" said scott winningham of j.s. winningham and co. the wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. \"for the time being, the fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,\" said darwin beck of first boston corp. \"i expect it to continue in that vein.\" \"excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs,\" added first chicago's johnson. banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. after the fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward m-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended february 16. looking ahead, economists said the fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar's progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy. \"the market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on fed policy,\" said first chicago's johnson. \"of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing.\" reuter ", "203": "federal industries launches eurobond issue <federal

inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september. finance minister edouard balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint. but trade union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises. and bank economists contacted by reuters said they believed prime minister jacques chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in presidential elections due by april 1988. \"the outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,\" said societe generale economist alain marais. \"we have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year.\" \"the big question is whether the government's policy of wage moderation will be maintained,\" he added. the government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity. but the head of the socialist cfdt union federation, edmond maire, meeting with chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices. calling the government's policies \"unbalanced and unjust,\" he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. he announced after his meeting that chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training andre bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate force ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to chirac earlier in the week while the communist-led cgt, the largest of france's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority. but with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident chirac could resist union pay demands. \"salary indexation was ended by the previous socialist government and i dont think this administration is going to reverse that,\" commented michel develle, economist at recently-privatised banque paribas. damaging transport and electricity strikes over christmas and the new year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said. develle said paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent. \"but that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the second world war all french prices have been freed,\" he commented. finance ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in january living costs. but they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year. both marais and develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control. prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the national statistics institute, insee, marais said. but the second half year should be better, he added. ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said. so long as public sector wages are held down, higher value added tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said. reuter ", "209": "gti corp <gti> 4th qtr oper net oper shr profit six cts vs loss two cts oper net profit 225,000 vs loss

largely responsible for vitalising the u.s. bond market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the u.s., britain, france and hong kong, fund managers said. after concentrating on u.s. treasury bonds for years, japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on similar types of investments, they said. japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986, shigeki matsumoto of nikko securities co ltd, said. matsumoto, who manages nikko's investment research and strategy, said there is evidence japanese investors began poking around in foreign stockmarkets around july last year, but few made firm commitments until december when net purchases suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each of the previous five months. net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added. this sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw the widest smiles from wall street because about 70 to 80 pct of funds will be invested in the u.s. markets, matsumoto said. \"the trend has been to head toward the u.s. market, first because of its size and next because it has been successful over the last couple of years,\" said eugene atkinson, managing director of goldman sachs international corp. wall street's massive turnover offers good liquidity, enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in and out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added. however, few see holdings in u.s. treasuries dwindling. they will remain a japanese mainstay, fund managers said. institutions, particularly life insurance companies which concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover payouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their u.s. treasuries, but will put in less money, said shinichi kobuse, manager of yamaichi securities co ltd's international fixed income activities. there has been some selling of u.s. bonds by short-term investors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a significant chunk of japanese bond holdings because the liquidity of the u.s. bond market remains attractive, he added. kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the u.s. equity markets despite predictions by economists the u.s. economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months. interest in wall street has been spurred by recent reports of significant growth in earnings by major u.s. corporations, he added. yutaka hashimoto general manager of nippon life insurance co told an economic conference that insurance companies, which are responsible for 26 pct of japanese funds in foreign securities, hold a lopsided proportion of u.s. treasuries and intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies. insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the u.s., but will now invest in britain, west germany, france and other countries, hashimoto said. lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the strength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to offset currency risks, he added. one trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in u.s. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund investment stategies. the bank is looking more at u.s. equities and european bonds, he said. japanese investments in british equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said andrew sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at county securities japan. \"last week was the busiest week we had,\" he said. investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of british companies and the recent deregulation of government controlled firms, fund managers said. deregulation in france is also attracting japanese interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the french franc, they said. investments in hong kong will be mostly short-term and speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term political stability, they added. japanese investors are cautious about west germany,

is now expected to make no contribution to australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending june 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, treasurer paul keating said here. however, he did not say in his speech to the economic planning advisory council (epac) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised. but keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth. the august budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points. keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated. \"the government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,\" he said. partial indicators released since the last meeting of epac in december indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, keating said. \"they indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time,\" he said. \"on the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment.\" keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct. \"nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane,\" he said. keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand. he said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income. the moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year. \"the current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88,\" keating said. \"as the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,\" he said. reuter ", "227": "thai rice exports rise in week ended february 24

export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. the special meeting of the international coffee organization (ico) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. however, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. world coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the international coffee agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut brazil\"s output by nearly two thirds. brazil is the world\"s largest coffee producer and exporter. producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said. tempers flared late saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. the big producers \"want to have the ball only in their court and it isn\"t fair,\" minority producer spokesman luis escalante of costa rica said. the majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas april 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before september 30, delegates said. their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, colombia 17 pct, ivory coast seven pct and indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. but consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. their proposals would give brazil a smaller quota share and colombia and indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said. delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. \"anything is possible at this phase,\" even adjournment of the meeting until march or april, one said. if the ico does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said. retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even

not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain,\" the report says. \"the modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels.\" constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines. the fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as \"wereng\" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. the outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types. the government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says. but while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (oct-sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. the report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last september\"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand. the report said that indonesia\"s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. it compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984. the dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump. reuter ", "235": "kuwait says no plans for emergency opec talks kuwait\"s oil minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency opec meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. sheikh ali al-khalifa al-sabah was quoted by the local daily al-qabas as saying: \"none of the opec members has asked for such a meeting.\" he denied kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate opec is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in geneva last december. they named kuwait and the united arab emirates, along with the much smaller producer ecuador, among those producing above quota. kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. \"this rumour is baseless. it is based on reports which said kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. they suppose that because kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the minister said. sheikh ali has said before that kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd. \"if we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said. he was referring apparently to the gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by opec last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. prices in new york last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. sheikh ali also delivered \"a challenge to any international oil company that declared kuwait sold below official prices.\" because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. however, kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added. he reaffirmed that the planned meeting march 7 of opec\"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of april at the request of certain of the body\"s members. ecuador\"s deputy energy minister fernando santos alvite said last wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted opec to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec\"s pricing committee. referring to pressure by oil companies on opec members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by qatar, he said: \"we expected such pressure. it will continue through march and april.\" but he expected the situation would later improve. reuter ", "236": "indonesia seen at crossroads over economic change indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the u.s. embassy says in a new report. to counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. indonesia, the only asian member of opec and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in september. but the u.s. embassy report says president suharto\"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. \"(it) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\" the report says. it primarily assesses indonesia\"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country\"s general economic performance. it says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, \"there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.\" \"this group strongly favours an import substitution economy,\" the report says. indonesia\"s economic changes have been welcomed by the world bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. three sets of measures have been announced since last may, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. the report says indonesia\"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. \"this is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s,\" the report notes. indonesia, the largest country in south-east asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in april. but the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. \"for 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.\" \"growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,\" the report states. bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. a new world bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the bank

defence expenditure in the hindu-majority nation where playing on fear of aggression by moslem pakistan has proved a vote winner. the indian express, the country\"s biggest selling paper, said: \"the defence cow has never been holier.\" the sunday mail newspaper branded the budget \"shamelessly political.\" it said in a front page commentary the \"budget is bad for growth, bad for prices, bad for

education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. he told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of money-losing public sector industries. gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation policy launched two years ago. reaction in bombay, india\"s business capital, was generally unfavourable. businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. it also failed to boost industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the 1985-90 development plan. nalin vissanji, president of the indian merchants chambers of commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove surtax on corporate income. shares on the bombay stock exchange, india\"s biggest, fell in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed gandhi\"s proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities industry. the exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and trading was suspended several times. brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in capital gains tax on stock sales. stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of three years without incurring capital

announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals. the deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. in a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, finance and petroleum minister sheikh abdul-aziz bin khalifa al-thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. sheikh abdul-aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. the government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. sheikh abdul-aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. he urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. he did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. sheikh abdul-aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. he added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services,

"gulf bond, stock markets lag behind, gib says gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <gulf international bank bsc> (gib) said. the bank's economist henry azzam said in a review of gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. \"greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said. the gib study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. azzam said gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. \"nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said. most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. only kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. but with dwindling financial surpluses in the gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, azzam said. he said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had \"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.\" in addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. a sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. he called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of gulf cooperation council (gcc) states -- bahrain, kuwait, qatar, oman, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates (uae). some moves had been taken in this direction, with bahrain allowing gcc nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. azzam said gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in saudi arabia. but he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in saudi arabia, qatar, oman or the uae, with the last saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. while bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in saudi arabia has picked up, establishment of

market oil prices, nazer said saudi arabia \"is fully adhering by the ... accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.\" nazer, quoted by spa, said recent pressure on free market prices \"may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.\" saudi arabia was a main architect of the december accord, under which opec agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. the agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. nazer was quoted by

agriculture ministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests by european farmers, community officials said. the common target for the farmers' wrath is the ec's brussels commission, which for the fourth year running has called for radical changes in the price support system. ec agriculture commissioner frans andriessen says huge food surpluses, which have alienated international trade partners and pushed the community to the edge of bankruptcy, demand such action. with community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes of unwanted cereals, over one mln tonnes of butter and huge stocks of wine and olive oil, andriessen says bluntly the days of open-ended price guarantees must end. ec agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices paid to community farmers before an april 1 deadline for the new marketing year, an increasingly difficult task as ec members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline. andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices, coupled with reductions in other support mechanisms, which could lead to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products. a producer's right to sell into ec warehouses at a fixed guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases. the latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on agriculture virtually stable. ec farm policies now swallow two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion european currency units (ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected shortfall this year of about five billion ecus. the most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils and fats tax and a change in the \"green\" exchange rate system, which translates ec farm prices into national currencies. the tax, of up to 330 ecus per tonne, would be levied on imported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could trigger a fresh trade dispute with the united states, which provides the ec with the bulk of its soybeans. it would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter consumption. west germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, which would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with weak and strong currencies were brought more into line. reuter ", "263": "qantas

including a 300 mln mark private placement for deutsche bank. issues for all of february rose to nearly five billion marks, from 3.6 billion in january. the heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very best addresses were having to accept higher coupons. \"i think the d-mark market is still good, but only if you can give a good coupon,\" another manager said. but even some government borrowers were not getting the best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more readily under other conditions. of the three mark eurobonds launched on tuesday alone, bonds for den danske bank and iceland were trading outside fees on friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows. den danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on friday at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and iceland's 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price. a 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for nippon telegraph and telephone was also depressed, but traded friday

its 99-1/2 price, thanks mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said. the large amount of paper brought to the market in the last two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain about the bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which they say is too inflexible. currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be registered with the bundesbank in the week preceding the two-week issue period. a bank may decline to issue a bond on the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the next calendar period to schedule the bond again. some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system. the bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks from four weeks last july. but few expect the calendar to be completely abolished. \"i don't think the bundesbank would give that up,\" one banking analyst said. \"i wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,\" the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the volume of new issues themselves. the bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through the euromarket, he said. for this reason, few managers here foresee the bundesbank sacrificing its present calendar system. bond activity in west german bond trading and syndication departments is also

domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of public bond issues, they said. \"relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from

planned for january 1988. \"nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration, which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican,\" rei shiratori, professor of politics at dokkyo university, told reuters. \"nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer,\" shiratori said. some ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) members of parliament have spoken against the tax, which nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes. nakasone today called for disciplinary action against ldp members who oppose the tax. \"there are some who are objecting because of their constituencies,\" he told a meeting of government and party leaders. \"if the party discipline is broken, i would like to see punishment considered.\" \"a proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly because nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it,\" shiratori said. \"moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's appreciation and about the future when the japanese society is rapidly aging,\" he said. political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for april, involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and assemblies at all levels. but the situation is complicated, since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the ldp, the political analysts added. shiratori said, \"in the worst case, implementation of the sales tax, now scheduled for next january, may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision. \"another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct. \"a third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of ldp mps,\" he said. seizaburo sato, professor of

boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. members of the seven-member kuala lumpur-based atpc account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. under the atpc plan, malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, indonesia 24,516, thailand 19,000, bolivia 13,761, zaire 1,736 and nigeria 1,461. australia has said it is not setting any export quota. however, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. comment from officials in zaire was unavailable. mine officials in malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started march 1. chief inspector of mines redzuan sumun told reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. mine owners in malaysia have welcomed the atpc export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. more than 100 applications for licences are pending. redzuan said the mines department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. atpc chairman and indonesia's mining and energy minister subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. a spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company pt tambang timah told reuters it would be easy for indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. in bangkok, thai industry minister pramual sabhavasu said thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. to insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter thailand smelting and refining co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. the thai mineral resources department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. but mining industry council president dam teutong told reuters that

expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. mining minister jaimie villalobos told reuters in la paz that bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. he said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of october 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of bolivia's total exports. he said there were risks in the atpc plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. he did not elaborate. mines, power and steel minister bunu sheriff musa said in lagos that nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its atpc quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. industry sources told reuters that nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. atpc officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. the atpc officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. they added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the atpc's discretion. the atpc would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. non-members brazil and china have pledged to cooperate with the atpc and limit

miguel corp> (smc) may follow the philippine government's appointment of a well-known banker to the smc board, investment analysts said. they told reuters the presence of <united coconut planters bank> (ucpb) president ramon sy to the board of smc may mean changes in smc management, which for decades was controlled by the family of its president, andres soriano. sy was appointed by a government commission that controls 51 pct of san miguel's stock, after another nominee resigned. the presidential commission on good government (pcgg) holds six seats on the 15-member smc board, which represent 33.13 mln sequestered shares. the stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned by eduardo cojuangco, then chairman of ucpb and san miguel. he was a close associate of deposed president ferdinand marcos, and he left the country after marcos's fall. before the seizure, soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid for the shares, paying ucpb a 500 mln peso deposit. the bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. they traded at 93 pesos today, down from 95.50 at friday's close. finance secretary jaime ongpin told reporters on saturday that sy would definitely sit on the smc board despite the objections of some directors associated with soriano. \"i don't think there is a conflict of interest as such,\" he said. \"i was potentially concerned with seeing a situation where you have a contentious atmosphere on the board. but sy has assured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in a contentious manner,\" ongpin added. the soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposing sy's directorship. its lawyer said in a letter to the pcgg that a pending suit seeking forfeiture of smc's 500 mln peso deposit and major undisclosed damages against the brewery represented a clear conflict. ucpb, however, sought board representation before sy's appointment, petitioning the pcgg \"so that the interests of the owners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected.\" investment analysts polled by reuters said the ucpb had a right to a slot on the smc board as trustee for coconut farmers who claim ownership of the disputed shares. the analysts said sy, backed by the government, would probably suggest replacements for pcgg nominees expected to resign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting government officials from working for private companies. smc's annual election is scheduled for may. a ucpb spokesman declined to comment, saying it was up to the pcgg to decide whom to appoint. one analyst said objections were understandable from the family that founded the company 97 years ago. \"it is a natural instinct of self-preservation for soriano,\" he said. smc posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on net sales of 10.99 billion

large deficit will push up india's moderate inflation rate and that the country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty, economists, politicians and stockbrokers told reuters. the projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending march, is 56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate of a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87. the projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based on wholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86. economists pointed out that the government itself had expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87 economic survey report published last week. presenting the budget to parliament on saturday, prime minister gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to trim large non-development expenditures. the deficit for 1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, he said. but few analysts have taken gandhi's assurance seriously. they say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees. lal krishna advani, president of the opposition bharatiya janata party, said gandhi's failure to mention specific measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices. economists said increased liquidity in the economy, as reflected by expansion of the m3 aggregate money supply, may cause prices to rise. the survey report showed the m3 rose by 15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of 1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86 period. economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects, after bad weather last year, may strain prices further. economists said the deficit would also cause the government to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. market loans and bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, up from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion. no reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes, which will discourage savings, economists said. avinash purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned union bank of india, said the annual inflation rate may double to around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency notes to cover the deficit. brokers said stock market investors have started selling long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the budget that reduces the holding period required to claim exemption from the capital gains

present hectic selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the scene. \"just now there is acute nervousness in the market,\" he said. brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help

measures in hungary hungary is to embark on a new series of austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled last year after quadrupling in 1985. the target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by parliament last december was 43.8 billion forints. but zoltan boesze, chief of the finance ministry's budget financing division, told reuters the government now saw this as too high and had decided \"quite severe\" measures were needed. \"all the organizations of economic management have been charged with elaborating further (savings) measures,\" he said. asked if these measures were being taken under pressure from the international monetary fund (imf), boesze said: \"the fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results, and of course the fund would support these efforts.\" imf teams spent several weeks in budapest late last year. boesze said preliminary figures showed that hungary's state budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984. the economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints because of poor performance by state firms, which needed subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency. the exact extent and nature of savings are still under discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest budget item -- must definitely fall, boesze said. subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low consumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164 billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985. parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints. \"i think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,\" boesze said. \"the central administration must be hard. ... if we are not hard then we will not be successful.\" boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and 800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. \"i believe these reserves should not be used at all,\" he said. wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic product, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct. the authorities had already signalled a small fall in real wages for 1987, but boesze said firms will suffer severe tax penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct. this would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986. a four-month basic wage freeze expires on april 1. about 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and 33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices. boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant cuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made this difficult. but he added: \"i think ultimately we will be able to make curtailments in subsidies in this area as well.\" he said hungary plans to introduce price reform at the beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and value added tax. the imf supports these aims. hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last september in an attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms. between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. labour discipline is being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily. boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to shed labour. he gave no exact figures. istvan nagy, a senior finance ministry official responsible for drafting the bankrupcy law, told reuters last year he hoped the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct. after subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion). interest payments on international debt are set to rise to more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven billion in 1986, boesze said. hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year to 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while trade with western countries plunged into a deficit of more than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years earlier. boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct by credits from the national bank, mostly from abroad, and 10 pct by the issue of domestic state bonds. deputy prime minister frigyes berecz told hungarian economists in a speech this month that the country's economy was in a \"very difficult\" situation, but not in crisis. there would have to be a turnround with tangible results this year, however, and borrowing must be used more effectively. \"any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous,\" berecz said. reuter ", "335": "u.k. money market shortage forecast revised down the bank of

half the size of the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with almost no loss of sound quality. this aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape piracy and loss of royalties. in negotiations that delayed the dat player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry be built into the machines. machines sold in japan are fitted with a computer chip to prevent copying through a digital signal. but copies can still be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier. \"nobody can tell the difference,\" one salesman said. dat players have been kept off western markets and some countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. but japanese hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a profitable niche. prices of dat players will probably fall quickly, possibly to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their products on the market, industry analysts said. they said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per year. philips of the

italy's leading economists and a professor at rome university. according to spaventa, these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last 15 years, with italy one minute seen as the \"bad boy of europe\" and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration, \"i think there's a lot of exaggeration...once it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to italy to study this. that was another story about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark room.\" spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialists here, stress italy's recent achievements, particularly the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable. profits of private sector firms such as fiat s.p.a., <fiat.m> and <ing. c. olivetti and c. s.p.a.> are booming, the major state industries are back in the black after years of losses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of payments deficits have been slashed. expectations by some experts that italy is poised to replace britain as the world's fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism. italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its second-rate status among the major industrialised countries. only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of this status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers from the group of five (g-5) - comprising the united states, japan, west germany, france and britain. italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in tokyo last year to let italy and canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system. but italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy, economists and industrialists say. \"we must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy,\" warns fiat managing director cesare romiti. he says that while italy's recent achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than those already solved. the country's huge state sector deficit, high unemployment and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most worrying problems, experts say. the size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at 109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion lire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral again, says carlo scognamiglio, head of the private luiss university in rome. inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a decade in september 1984 and by january this year was running at 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee international competiveness, economists and industrialists say. and unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last october according to the latest official data. recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million people seeking work in october 1986, almost 73 pct were aged between 14 and 29. unemployment in the south was running at 17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north. the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) recently forecast that italian gross domestic product (gdp) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct in 1986. but it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to check rising unemployment. another problem is italy's reliance on imported raw materials. the country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs. this factor actually worked sharply in italy's favour last year, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade deficit to 3,717 billion lire by year end from 23,085 billion lire in 1985. but economists say the improvement owes little to any structural change in the italian economy and that any reversal of the trend in costs could have serious consequences. if italy truly wants to be counted among the world's top industrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities, economists say. italy has no controls on insider trading. the country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements controls -- a european community directive calls for these to be dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating procedures, economists say. \"even today, if i wanted to invest in the tokyo bourse, i doubt i'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks which would allow me to do that,\" says spaventa. reuter ", "340": "u.k. money market receives 37 mln stg assistance the bank of england said it had provided

the u.s. kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. the talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of u.s./japan economic relations, will pave the way for american secretary of state george schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from china. faced with growing congressional protectionist pressure, the u.s. administration is pressing japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, u.s. officials said. \"we appreciate their frustration,\" a senior japanese government official said. \"but we are also frustrated.\" the official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. that has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said. he said the u.s. administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with congress. \"it would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,\" a senior u.s. official replied. the talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in japan's favour. on the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. the structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. these talks come at a particularly delicate time for the japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. some u.s. officials complained japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as washington wants. japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge u.s. budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. that budget deficit has meant that the u.s. is buying more imports. japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. \"it condemns japan without due process,\" one japanese official said. that reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by democratic senator lloyd bentsen, he said. japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the u.s., officials said. nevertheless, japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. \"we have no leverage,\" one official admitted. as a result, tokyo is striving to meet u.s. complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. the u.s. is pressing for greater access to the japanese super computer market. the japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential

100 tonnes between august and october last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the ec market if they continue at the same pace. the industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct

proposed growth facility. ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics. \"secretary monsod and i get along famously,\" he said. \"she talks and i listen but i don't necessarily agree.\" monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging the financing gap would have aided the government's pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan. she said if private sector investment continued to be held back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates, the country would fail to achieve its gross national product (gnp) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over the next six years. \"if you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan. how can there be a program if there is no finance?\" she said, adding ongpin's stand was not good

american express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. american express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of shearson would bring. analysts speculated that all of shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. to some however, the need for added capital is puzzling. \"(american) express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to,\" said larry eckenfelder of prudential-bache securities. analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of shearson management wednesday. chief operating officer jeffrey lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president. the reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts speculated would allow shearson to be a stand alone company. analysts, contacted on sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. it does confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. late last year, shearson's takeover offer to the e.f. hutton group inc was rejected by hutton, and analysts said there had been speculation that shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major wall street brokerage. reuter ", "362": "spanish farmers protest, then call truce spanish farmers demanding a better deal from the european community blocked roads and staged protest rallies this

with a net gain worth 905 mln swiss francs, the finance ministry said. the surplus, including cash transactions and long-term investments, contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billion francs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986 budget. all categories of revenues were higher than forecast, and expenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast. the finance ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18 billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61 billion proposed in the original 1986 budget. tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985 figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71 billion. this left a surplus on cash transactions totalling 1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985 deficit of 696 mln. income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs above forecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expected receipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions. taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more than planned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said. the ministry said the improvement in the overall account reflected years of efforts by the government and parliament to introduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary tax increases. but economic factors, including the low rate of inflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oil prices were also important factors. a spokesman for the ministry said the government had used its improved cash position to retire about one billion francs of government debt, which accounted for the difference

one megabyte of memory, expandable to eight megabytes. it can be equipped with a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor. in a demonstration of its speed and power, company executives said they

bankamerica corp's <bac> bank of america unit last week issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card receivables via sole manager first boston. dub said the offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors. the bank of america offering followed a january 16 issue of 200 mln dlrs of similar debt by republicbank corp's <rpt> republicbank delaware unit. goldman, sachs and co ran the books on that deal, with first boston acting as co-manager. however, dub said the bank of america securities were more closely related to the so-called \"cars deals\" that raced to market last year than were the republicbank securities. \"the republicbank issue was secured by credit card receivables. in contrast, the bank of america deal was the first public offering of credit card receivables because we used a grantor trust vehicle,\" he said. in a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest in the trust, analysts explained. the bank of america certificates were issued by california credit card trust a, which the bank established for that single purpose, investment bankers pointed out. the debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in 1992. first boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over comparable treasury securities. non-callable for life, the deal was rated aaa by both moody's and standard and poor's. underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the bank of america deal was priced too aggressively. \"aaa-rated auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over treasuries when first boston priced the deal,\" one said. however, dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway. the first boston executive attributed this to the deal's top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's cars deals, which were rated by s and p alone. \"investors receive interest only payments for the first 18 months and then interest and principal payments for the remaining five to seven months,\" dub detailed. investment bankers pointed out that because the bank of america deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals that were brought to market late last year. the collateral for the trust includes a pool of visa credit card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. bank of america has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making it one of the biggest in the u.s., analysts said. last week's deal was

administration tattered by the iran-contra arms scandal. reagan and former senate republican leader howard baker, whose appointment as white house chief of staff won bipartisan praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade u.s. arms with iran for help in freeing ameican hostages in lebanon. among the chores facing reagan's new inner circle is assessing the damage the 300-page tower commission report has done to the nomination of robert gates to succeed william casey as the new head of the central intelligence agency. white house officials are checking to see how much support gates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would have if his nomination is submitted to the full senate for a vote, senate republican leader robert dole said. appearing on the nbc news program, \"meet the press,\" the kansas senator said the gates nomination \"could be in some difficulty.\" aides said that gates' future would be given high priority by baker. even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale scandal, lawmakers said senate confirmation of the gates nomination is not assured and, even if won, would come only after months of congressional probes into the affair. \"he has the smell of iran on him,\" said former nevada sen. and reagan confidant paul laxalt. \"he is a victim.\" laxalt, appearing on the abc news program, \"this week with david brinkley,\" bluntly admitted \"the gates nomination is in trouble.\" senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn said the odds are now slightly against confirmation of gates. when asked on the syndicated television program, \"john mclaughlin: one on one,\" if he thought gates would be confirmed, the georgia democrat shot back: \"i wouldn't bet any money on it. \"i think this report hurts that,\" nunn said. \"it indicates that the national security council had policy-type influence over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into that with mr. gates. only a day after it was issued last week, the tower report prompted the abrupt exit of donald regan as white house chief of staff. regan, the former wall street executive and treasury secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past two years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the botched handling of the iran arms sale. the report blamed regan for the \"chaos that descended on the white house\" since it was first revealed last november that profits from the iran arms sales had been diverted to contra rebels fighting the leftist nicaraguan government. the two other victims of the scandal are former national security adviser vice adm. john poindexter who resigned and marine lt. col. oliver north who was fired after it was disclosed last november 23 that profits from the iran arms sale were diverted to the contras. the two, pictured by the tower commission as the key operators of the iran arms deal, have refused to testify. reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed in the tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy. that perception has wrecked reagan's popularity and threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves office in january 1989. a recent newsweek magazine poll found that just 40 pct of americans approved of reagan's leadership, a record low, and a third believed he should consider resignation. after meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over the meaty report of the commission headed by former texas sen.

existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt, finance minister dilson funaro said. u.s. banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of brazil's debt to banks, he said, adding \"this is not fair with the european and japanese banks.\" the committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983, however. noting the often different reactions of u.s., japanese and european banks, funaro told journalists that brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis, \"perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors,\" central bank president francisco gros said. brazil on february 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs. funaro and gros spent two days at the end of last week in washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit britain, france, west germany, switzerland and italy for discussions with governments. funaro and gros are today meeting british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson, foreign secretary geoffrey howe and governor of the bank of england robin leigh-pemberton. bankers have estimated that brazil owes u.k. banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the u.k. the third largest exposure after the u.s. and japan. the crisis began when brazil's trade surplus, its chief means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country's\u007fate of inflation. reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs. funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt. \"what we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service, because we cannot service all that,\" he said. \"i really think we have to change the old rules.\" asked why brazil was first approaching governments, rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis, funaro said \"we must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks, because the banks have some limits.\" \"it is a political discussion from our point of view,\" he said. funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to japanese and canadian government officials. he would then talk to the commercial banks \"if i've got some solution from the governments. i can't take the burden only to the banks.\" he was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution. \u007f in discussions with governments brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need. finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982. \"you must open these mechanisms,\" he said. he said that while the u.s. officials had been disturbed by brazil's suspension of interest payments, they understood brazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves. also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed \"because we can't stay as we were the last few years.\" \"i'm trying to put the problem on the table.... all of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium.\" he said. although brazil has rejected a substantive role for the international monetary fund (imf) in managing its economy, funaro paid a call in washington to imf managing director michel camdessus and to world bank president barber conable. funaro noted that inflation in february had started to decline again and he expected brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987. banking sources noted that brazil's monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months. brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world, funaro said, although its share of international trade was only one pct. \"the solution is linked with growth, not recession,\" he said, noting an imf program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt. banking sources said brazil's debts to foreign governments, as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounder structure following last month's rescheduling by the paris club of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt. reuter ", "419": "whittaker corp <wkr> 1st qtr jan 31 net oper shr 17 cts vs 25 cts qtly div 15 cts vs 15 cts prior oper net 1,522,000 vs 3,501,000 sales

negotiations on brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves, a treasury spokesman said. the spokesman said the chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with funaro the need for the brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic program to the country's creditors. he added an accord with the international monetary fund (imf) could be a very helpful support. brazil on february 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks. lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis. funaro, accompanied by central bank president francisco gros, is on the first leg of a tour of european capitals in an attempt to explain to governments brazil's indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month. brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the imf in managing its economy, arguing that an imf austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy. funaro and gros last week visited washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth. funaro said on saturday in washington that brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies. he said earlier today that brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium \"because the banks have some limits.... it's a political discussion from our point of view.\" funaro said on friday that his talks with u.s. officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve brazil's debt crisis, describing the meeting as an initial contact. he had earlier met federal reserve board chairman paul volcker and u.s. treasury secretary james baker. the treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had been at funaro's request. after travelling this week to france, germany, switzerland and

the company by 1.50 dlrs a share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities. in a filing with the securities and exchange commission, redstone, who controls dedham, mass.,-based national amusements inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash portion of its viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs. redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs. the redstone offer, which is being made through arsenal holdings inc, a national amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose, which also give viacom shareholders one-fifth of a share of arsenal common stock after the takeover. viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from redstone and mcv holdings inc, a group led by viacom management which is competing with redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with viacom. the company did not disclose the details of the revised offers, but said a special committee of its board would review them later today. the redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in viacom, and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock. the two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements, which give them access to viacom's financial records provided they keep the information secret. in his sec filing, redstone, who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said bank of america is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs. besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate, bank of america has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs, redstone said. merrill lynch, pierce fenner and smith inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier, redstone said. redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover. the redstone equity contribution to the takeover would consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 viacom common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said. the new offer, the second sweetened deal redstone has proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said. last week, the management group submitted what it

adjust capacity to lower demand. industry commissioner karl-heinz narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by december 1988. he has proposed a return to the free market, which under ec law is supposed to exist except in times of \"manifest crisis.\" but diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on march 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. ministers from the ec's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. industry sources said the plan presented to narjes by the ec steelmakers' lobby group eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a \"voluntary\" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. eurofer added the

tightening s/p trading directors of the chicago mercantile exchange will meet wednesday to consider a membership petition asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading activities in the widely-popular standard and poor's 500 stock index futures pit, an exchange executive said. the petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legal practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade for their own account. but exchange officials noted this practice also provides an opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called \"front-running\", where traders enter orders for their own account before executing orders for their customers. leo melamed, cme special counsel, said directors will rule on the petition on wednesday, but added that a special s and p advisory committee has been studying s and p 500 futures trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days. in addition to a recommendation on dual trading, melamed said the special committee will also make suggestions about a possible automatic order entry and execution system for s and p 500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit. melamed said directors are likely to approve the recommendations of the special committee because \"most actions of the board are in line with committee recommendations.\" cme senior vice president gerald beyer said if the board accepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will be submitted to the commodity futures trading commission for approval. if the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request, a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership for a vote within 15 days, beyer said. melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on before the recommendations from the special committee are made \"it will confuse the issue.\" not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict dual trading. although jonathan wolff, senior vice president at donaldson lufkin and jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on most exchanges. \"it's a question of the integrity of the person you do business with,\" wolff said. futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain that trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in chaotic futures trading pits. \"to have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult for a broker to function because of his errors,\" said john michael, vice president at first options of chicago. \"what it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved,\" he said. furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokerage makes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said. \"if i ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), or even suspected him of doing it, i would cut him off,\" michael said. an average broker in the treasury bond futures pit, for instance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a day at 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said. even figuring what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such brokerage can be lucrative. front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of an adverse price move, but also the risk of losing the brokerage business, michael said. reuter ", "540": "benguet corp <be>

problem more than two mln tonnes of surplus maize dotted across zimbabwe in huge piles is posing an economic headache for the country. the grain, southern africa's staple, has been bought by the grain marketing board (gmb) at prices guaranteed before it was planted, and is costing the gmb about 27 mln dlrs a month in storage and interest payments to make the purchases. accumulated over the past two years of bumper harvests, the surplus represents about two years of domestic consumption and is set to grow as further deliveries are due shortly. some deals have been made with aid donors, such as european countries and australia, to provide zimbabwe with wheat in return for maize sent to neighbouring mozambique, where the united nations has urged greater world efforts to feed the hungry. but transport constraints keep those figures low and the only significant dent was a sale of 250,000 tonnes to south africa last year. because of the costs it has incurred, the gmb cannot afford to give the maize away and the standard 90 kg bags have been accumulating, economists here said. but failure to find buyers on glutted world grain markets is damaging zimbabwe, as it needs foreign exchange to finance imports for other areas of the economy, the economists added. \"at present, it is a no-win situation. let us hope some of the extra aid (un) secretary general javier perez de cuellar called for at the weekend will be spent here,\" a western aid specialist said. \"at least this year's poor rains haven't exacerbated the situation too badly,\" he added. rainfall during the current rainy season has been far below average, ravaging all but the irrigated lands of large commercial farmers. while this may curb the amount of maize delivered this year to the gmb, the government also acted late last year to slash maize production and force diversification. calling for a switch to other crops such as oilseeds, agriculture minister moven mahachi said an economically-viable price of 180 dlrs a tonne would be paid this year for only half the amount of maize bought by the gmb in 1986, and above that growers would be paid an unprofitable 100 dlrs. the poor rains have also adversely affected other crops, such as sorghum, soybeans, groundnuts, tobacco and cotton, the agriculture ministry reported at the end of february. reuter ", "634": "technology/chip industry seeks custom designs u.s. semiconductor manufacturers, struggling to stem a river of red ink, are increasingly looking toward customized designs rather than mass-market chips for future profits. the market for customized chips - semiconductors designed for a very specific application or product - is expected to expand by 25 to 30 pct this year, compared with only about six pct for the entire integrated circuit industry. market researcher dataquest inc estimates that sales of customized chips totaled about 4.5 billion dlrs worldwide last year, about 12 pct of the total chip market. by 1990, however, customized chips are expected to represent a 12 billion to 15 billion dlr market, about 25 pct of total chip sales. more important for their vendors, because they are not a standard design customized chips represent a sellers' market, and prices and profit margins can be set accordingly. high volume memory chips have become \"a perfect commodity market,\" robert brodersen, a professor of electrical engineering at the university of california at berkeley, told an industry forum. \"the product is interchangeable between one manufacturer and another and customers base their buying decisions almost entirely on price,\" brodersen said. he predicted that, in the next few years, only a handful of the world's largest chip manufacturers (most of them japanese) will produce memory chips, the standard electronic component found in everything from digital watches to computers. \"the rest of the industry just won't be involved.\" last week's international solid state circuits conference, the chip industry's annual forum for new developments, seemed to support brodersen's prediction. of the 116 papers presented at the conference, some 40 pct had japanese authors, the first time they have outnumberd the united states. most of the japanese chip designs were in the memory category, including nippon telephone and telegraph co's attention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory (dram) chip, 16 times more powerful than anything now available. the most advanced memory chip described by a u.s. company was international business machine corp's <ibm> four mln bit chip, and ibm only manufactures chips for its own internal use, not for the open market. the problem with memory chips is that they are all based on the same, well known design standards, so they are easy to copy and inexpensive to manufacture. because such large japanese conglomerates as sony corp <sne>, nec corp, <nipny> matushita and mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronics product lines, they also have a guaranteeed internal market for their chips, so they can produce huge amounts at a very low cost per unit. customized chips, however, are designed for a specific customer, manufactured in small quantities and expensive relative to standard chips. computer markets are increasingly looking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy, thus making the final product harder to clone as well. intel corp <intc>, the leading manufacturer of the microprocessors that form the brains of most computers, alerted the industry to its intention to switch to customized chips last fall. the company, which just reported a loss for 1986, said it will spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itself into a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips. intel joins some 275 companies already competing for a piece of the customized chip business but it has an advantage that the others do not. ibm, which owns a 20 pct stake in intel, has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15,000 chips it makes for its own use. intel will customize those designs and sell them to others. it will also get to use ibm's proprietary computer system for designing chips, considered by experts to be one of the most advanced in the world. intel's success is still not guaranteed, however. industry analysts noted that it is far different to design a mass market item than a customized chip that requires a close working relationship with the customer. intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing its newest 30386 microprocessor. a much faster turnarouond time, and much lower development costs, will be required for customized chips if the firm is to succeed. reuter ", "635": "sears to restructure distribution ", "636":

provision required by the office of the comptroller of the currency, the sec said. continental had originally listed 565 mln dlrs of the loan loss provision as a credit loss and another 425 mln dlrs

distressed loans to the federal deposit insurance corp, the sec said. the bank should have listed 990 mln dlrs as a credit loss instead of 565 mln dlrs and should not have charecterized the other 425 mln dlrs as a provision for loss on sale of loans, the sec said. continental agreed to the settlement with the sec without admitting or denying any violations, the sec said. but it agreed to restate its 1984 financial statements to accommodate the sec's objections and to report to its shareholders a summarized version of the sec's administrative action against it, the agency said. a continental

regret this outcome, but the responsibility for it rests entirely with the local union bargaining committees,\" the company said in a statement. \"we will, therefore, initiate the actions necessary to place the new jeep product in an alternative location rather than at kenosha.\" uaw officials said during the weekend they did not regard the collapse of talks as final after the company's \"final\" proposal on a new contract was unanimously rejected by union bargainers. but amc said the union's rejection of its concessions package means that plants in kenosha and milwaukee will lose 6,500 jobs because the assembly complex in kenosha \"will not be getting new work\" as had been proposed with a new contract. \"this unfortunate outcome demonstrates the difficulty of maintaining existing

broker sees wider data access the major u.s. government bond brokers are likely to give in to pressure from regulators and investors within the next 18 months, making their direct-dealing screens

holdings corp, one of the largest of the four bond brokers that dominate the business. in a telephone interview, lacy said \"within 18 months, we think the number of players will be expanded.\" currently, the four major brokers will sell their direct-dealing screens to only primary dealers in u.s. government securities or those that have applied to the federal reserve bank of new york to become a primary dealer. the u.s. justice department is looking into whether limiting access to the screens to just a small group of dealers is a violation of u.s. anti-trust laws. primary dealers, of which there are now 40, are an elite group of firms approved to buy treasury securities directly from the fed. but lacy said that any agreement to expand access to the brokers' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not as far-reaching as some would like. instead of making screens available to any firm willing to pay for one, he said, it is more likely that a \"second tier\" will be established. he also said that rmj is not willing to break away from the group of bond brokers and be the only firm to make its screens widely available to any one who wants them. bond market sources had speculated that rmj is better prepared to offer its services nationwide than its three major competitors. lacy also said that he does not see any immediate pressure for a further cut in commissions paid on bond transactions any time soon. in late 1985, transaction fees paid to brokers were cut in half to 39 dlrs per mln dlr transaction from 78 dlrs. some u.s. primary bond dealers have been

exchange spokeswoman. \"this will change the way oil is transacted in the real world,\" said said thomas mckiernan, mckiernan and co chairman. foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against nymex prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to nymex prices, mckiernan explained. the expanded program \"will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when nymex does,\" said frank capozza, secretary of century resources inc. the rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on nymex, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in u.s. energy futures, according to traders and analysts. currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or efp, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction. under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an efp and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials. when nymex announced its proposed rule change in december, nymex president rosemary mcfadden, said, \"expansion of the efp provision

point/viacom international <via> a bidding war for viacom international inc, one of the largest u.s. entertainment companies, pitted a management group and other investors against national amusements inc, a closely held theater operator. both sides raised their bids over the weekend. a source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. he said if outside directors approve the management proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week. \"it would take 20 days from the day we mail,\" said the source. the source predicted national amusements, controlled by investor sumner redstone, would need \"half a year\" to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of viacom's broadcast licenses and cable television franchises. redstone was not available for comment. some of wall street's arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. one said redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win. the independent directors of viacom were called into a meeting today. word on a decision was expected early tomorrow. viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. one major wall street firm issued a sell recommendation. \"we think we're at the end now, in terms of bidding,\" said the firm's arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified. both redstone's proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. the management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock. redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash, a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of arsenal holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured viacom. one arbitrageur calculated the equity in the redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share. management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. the arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond april 30 that a merger with arsenal is not consummated. the plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during may and 12 pct thereafter. previously redstone offered eight pct interest. other arbitrageurs said both redstone and the management group, led by president and chief executive terrence elkes, were offering high prices. \"redstone really wants to own the company,\" one said. another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue. redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov viacom's 35 mln shares. a wall street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. he noted as an example that new stock in fmc corp <fmc>, which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now just over 30 dlrs. last week, viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts. the

domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world. the council said that in the talks, canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of u.s. duties against allegedly subsidized exports. a recent example was the 15 per cent duty the u.s. imposed on canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized. the council said the chief u.s. concerns included ending curbs against u.s. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and the so-called \"cultural

supply reductions by the u.s. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said while the australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments. australia's proposals, which aim to reduce u.s. target prices and \"quarantine\" u.s. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on u.s. farmers, they said. other countries, including australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past u.s. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said. \"we will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers,\" jim miller, president of nawg said. \"we sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture,\" miller said. reuter ", "742": "gelco <gel> sees flat 1987 pretax operating net gelco corp said that, excluding the effects of a restructuring plan, it expects pre-tax operating earnings for the year to end

international inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company. pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for american medical with several large shareholders, including the biggest investor, the bass family of texas. however, the bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer, he said. pesch, in an interview with reuters, said based on the conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage whether he had majority support. he said, however, there is support for his offer. pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the bass family and the wedge group inc, the only other holder of more than five pct of american medical stock. earlier today, wedge group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, said it held discussions with pesch, american medical management and other american medical shareholders. wedge, in a filing with the securities and exchange commission, said it believes a restructuring of american medical and its business would be \"highly desirable and appropriate at this time.\" \"that's the sort of position that i find a large segment of shareholders of ami really share,\" said pesch. pesch said he held discussions with wedge about joining his takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each american medical share. wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of american medical, but it would not rule out a future takeover try. pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the bass family. some analysts saw the wedge statement as a boost to pesch's takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following american medical's previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from pesch. american medical is expected to resist pesch's latest bid. larry feinberg, an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out. an american medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new pesch offer by march 10. analysts continue to view the bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of american medical. the bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in american medical, and the company has previously said the investors support management's internal plan to improve the company's performance. the bass family would not comment on american medical or pesch. pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of republic health corp last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on wall street because of the long time it took to finish the republic acquisition. republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger american medical takeover proposal. pesch's first offer for american medical was made without an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to wall street. however, pesch entered his second offer with representation from donaldson, lufkin, and jenrette securities and security pacific merchant banking group. \"i don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment,\" pesch said. pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. he did say if he succeeds in acquiring american medical he plans to keep much of american medical management in place. he said he plans to combine the company with republic to form an efficient network of hospitals. analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for american medical. byron nimocks of e.f. hutton group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make american medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share. nimocks estimates american medical earnings for the second quarter ended february 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct loss last year. nimocks said pesch's revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously. but feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer. \"i think it's much more doable,\" he said. analysts have said american medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs. reuter ", "748": "three convicted in home state failure marvin warner and two fellow officers of the former home state savings bank were

(renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the united states but also to the newly industrialised countries.\" this could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-oecd area, which accounts for almost a quarter of french exports, it said. until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have \"little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly,\" it added. but rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the oecd said. written mainly in december last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in january consumer prices, caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs. \"we took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost,\" one oecd official commented. oecd officials said the january data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct. the government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct. but the oecd backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation. with french unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the oecd area, the inflation differential between france and its main trading rival, west germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said. on the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits. \"for the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,\" it said. reuter ", "843": "painewebber<pwj> unit ups shaer shoe <shs> stake mitchell hutchins asset management inc, a new york investment firm and subsidiary

"regan departure makes 3rd volcker term likely last week's white house shake-up has increased the odds that federal reserve board chairman paul volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the fed say. but they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this august, has been taken by the white house and volcker too has not made up his mind. former white house chief of staff donald regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator howard baker was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to volcker and tried often to undermine him. it is an open secret in washington that regan tried to ensure that volcker, first appointed in 1979 by president carter, will not be offered a third term by president reagan. only volcker's key allies in the reagan administration, vice-president george bush and treasury secretary james baker, kept regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said. sources close to the administration say regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that beryl sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace volcker. but as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire, it became clear that regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. the sources said new white house chief of staff howard baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the treasury department and is likely to respect his views on the fed chairmanship. as a moderate republican, baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to volcker. \"this new white house is going to need all the strength it can get,\" said one source when asked about the possibility of volcker's reappointment. paul volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the united states and around the world. at a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, volcker's departure would definitely undermine u.s. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say. u.s. officials say volcker works very closely with treasury secretary baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. the two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by volcker, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the treasury position. and a recent statement by a reagan administration official that the two men saw \"exactly eye-to-eye\" on the dollar was seen as an indication of baker's support for the fed chairman. baker is understood to have played a key role in volcker's reappointment to the fed in mid-1983. the sources said baker respects volcker and when appointed treasury secretary in february 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. regan, treasury secretary during president reagan's first term, was formerly head of wall street's largest brokerage firm merrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america's pre-eminent economic spokesman. he developed a deep antipathy for volcker, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much more seriously. but the sources said volcker would have to be invited to stay. \"is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise,\" said one. \"he'd have to be asked,\" said stephen axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the fed and now vice-chairman of nikko securities co. international. otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. and if volcker left this augsut, he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced fed boards in years. many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. an experienced successor, therefore, would seem a necessity. one widely mentioned possibility is secretary of state george shultz, whose experience as treasury secretary under preesident nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. but shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-iran scandal, while vice-chairman manuel johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. other potential candidates include economist alan greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic adviser, new york fed president e. gerald corrigan, federal deposit insurance corp chairman william seidman, and sprinkel. long a regan protege, sprinkel's chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the white house. reuter ", "854": "cbt february volume down 14 pct from year ago february

early today to prevent a deal on cutting overflowing milk production from turning sour before trying to agree widescale reforms in other surplus sectors. meanwhile, protests from angry european farmers over successive attempts to scale down unwanted community food production appeared to be gathering strength. in the northeastern spanish city of saragossa thousands of spanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand a better deal from brussels. the farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets and occupied local government buildings while in the southern city of malaga, citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets in protest at ec duties. towards the end of last week, about 10,000 angry west german farmers marched through the streets of hanover burning effigies of agriculture minister ignaz kiechle while in france pig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices. europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by the european commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limit farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into public stores at high guaranteed ec prices. in the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review, at which ec ministers set the levels of subsidies, agriculture commissioner frans andriessen has included measures that could result in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct. the plans form part of an on-going campaign to reform surplus-creating farm policies that have become a political embarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad and threatened to leave the community with no cash for other areas. andriessen's latest package comes only months after a decision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years and to slash beef prices by around 10 pct. that decision, agreed in outline last december after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations, was hailed as the most significant step yet in the reform offensive, but has since run into difficulties over the fine print. west germany and ireland are objecting to the new rules governing the sales of surplus butter into cold stores, but the commission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord has been used as the inspiration for andriessen's latest package. ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem, and resumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details before starting the price review which is confidently predicted to last many months. ec farm spending currently swallows two thirds of an overall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almost entirely blamed for

following a damaging drought in brazil. with no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted. lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said. the u.s. and brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. jon rosenbaum, u.s. assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, \"a majority of producers, led by brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria. \"we want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ico.\" brazilian coffee institute (ibc) president jorio dauster countered, \"negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them.\" previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. a majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. but most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce brazil's share to 28.8 pct. consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. a last-minute attempt by colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. delegates speculated brazil's financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some african nations and colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ico's failure to agree quotas, analysts said. the expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates forecast. the ico executive board will meet march 31, but the full council is not due to meet again until september, delegates said. reuter ", "875": "ec ministers postpone talks on saving dairy pact european community (ec) farm ministers early today abandoned talks aimed at saving an

access to the worst-hit towns of edgecumbe, whakatane and the forestry town of kawerau severely restricted. yesterday's quake measured 6.25 on the richter scale. the seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. but the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out. civil

fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,\" said takashi kiuchi, senior economist for the long-term credit bank of japan ltd. the government, which published the january unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. \"at present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,\" a labour ministry official said. finance minister kiichi miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in april. prime minister yasuhiro nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. the yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said. although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said koichi tsukihara, deputy general manager of sumitomo bank ltd's economics department. however, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. the economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. although japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned. \"the three pct figure could translate into a relatively high figure if european methods

chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last saturday the government could not fix the taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one u.s. dollar due to u.s. pressure for an appreciation of the local currency. the federation asked the government on february 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level. the federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall. it said the taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against the u.s. dollar since september 1985 while the south korean won climbed only four pct. the singapore and hong kong dollars remained stable against the u.s. unit in that period, it said. many local bankers and economists predict taiwan's dollar will rise to between

economists told reuters. they said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct in calendar 1986, indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pct shrinkage in 1985, the government was likely to hold its course and wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work. last march hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct, and income tax was reduced by the same margin. last year the government also reduced wage costs by introducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions to the mandatory state savings scheme, the central provident fund (cpf), to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct. \"i don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because the economy is now improving,\" said clemente escano, vice president of the union bank of switzerland. the government's economic report for calendar 1986, issued last week, said the cpf reduction and other cost-cutting measures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986. but the report said over half the economy -- especially the commerce, financial, and business services sectors -- continued to be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional economies and an excess of domestic property. the sources said the fragility of the economic recovery suggested the government would not introduce much of its planned consumption tax in the coming financial year. in last year's budget hu said he planned to set up collecting machinery for the tax. economists said a campaign against smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to levy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use. the sources said the government does not look likely to raise more revenue in this year's budget. last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budget deficit for fiscal 1986/87, but the economic report projected an overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion. lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income and stringent controls on government operating expenditure, helped by the wage-freeze policy. anthony k.p. lee, vice-president and deputy general manager of american express bank ltd, said he expected nothing exciting from this year's budget. lee said, \"it will probably be a non-event as most of the tax benefits were given last year. the economy has already started moving so it does not need government support.\" last week's economic report attributed the one pct decline in domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in private construction, so this sector hopes for some relief from the budget, economists said. the economic report said the sector's activity declined by 25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985. a further decline is expected in 1987. but in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax for industrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until the end of 1988, so the most hu is likely to do is add incentives for creating property investment unit trusts. the only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget are incentives to encourage population growth, including incentives to families who have three children. deputy prime minister goh chok tong has already announced the government will try to encourage three-child families,

should provide currency and interest rate futures, and incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock index futures contracts. the proposal said transactions in all these contracts must be conducted on the same market so participants can readily engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments. to make this possible, the proposal calls for new legislation which would administer all related futures and options transactions under the same legal framework. banking sources said they expect that initially the currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would include japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit, three-month eurodollar deposits and 20-year u.s. treasury bonds. banking sources quoted federation chairman yoshiro araki as saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible because it would help promote the liberalisation of japan's financial markets. araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective market

the u.s. request since the u.s. federal reserve bank of new york approved five new primary government securities dealers, including two japanese brokerages, last december. they said the ministry will have to approve the u.s. request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open to foreigners as those of the u.s. analysts said japan has proceeded rapidly with financial deregulation since 1984, but has not touched upon the clear division between the securities and banking businesses. japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to protect their interests, but analysts said the banks are finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional fields. officials of major japanese banks said they will pay special attention to the ministry's reaction to u.s. bank requests

with u.s. china called on the united states to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. but the u.s. embassy replied that chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the u.s. out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said peking itself would have to persuade congress to change laws which limit its exports. the official international business newspaper today published china's demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of u.s. secretary of state george shultz. \"it is extremely important that the u.s. market reduce its restrictions on chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand chinese exports,\" the editorial said. \"the u.s. should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for chinese goods and admit china into the generalised system of preference (gsp). \"despite easing of curbs on u.s. technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added the paper also printed an article by china's commercial counsellor in its washington embassy, chen shibiao, who said that \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. he named them as u.s. protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. the paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, china has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. it shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. a u.s. embassy official said the u.s. did not accept peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude goods shipped to hong kong and then trans-shipped to u.s. while u.s. figures are based on country of origin. he said that, if china wants to obtain gsp status, it will have to lobby congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent peking getting such status. the u.s. trade act of 1974 says that to qualify for gsp, china must be a member of the general agreement of tariffs and trade (gatt), for which it applied in july 1986, and \"not be dominated or controlled by international communism.\" the official said china was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the u.s. to change them. china has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the u.s. within the last two years, which the u.s. side won, he said. but, for the first time, china signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the u.s. side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added. another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in peking's application to gatt. \"china has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. other gatt countries will be nervous about china in this respect. but there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in gatt,\" the diplomat said. poland, czechoslovakia, hungary and romania are members of gatt but none has china's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. in a speech today in the northeast city of dalian, u.s. secretary of state george shultz said his country welcomed china's interest in participating in gatt. \"the process of chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the gatt rules were not designed for a large economy of the chinese type,\" shultz said. \"china can play an important role by actively joining gatt discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. china can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its gatt participation,\" he said. the problems facing u.s.-china trade and gatt membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system. in a memorandum backing its application presented to gatt last month, china said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with \"guidance planning\" and economic levers. the diplomat said that, to join gatt, china had much to do. reuter ", "925": "no bundesbank policy changes expected thursday the bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on thursday, as exchange rates

tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. the tender was announced last friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. dealers said the bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. but because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings, the bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender. \"i would not be surprised if the bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,\" one dealer said. \"they would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is

country's debt problems, senior west german banking sources said. the sources, speaking ahead of a meeting later today between brazilian finance minister dilson funaro and his west german counterpart gerhard stoltenberg, also believed brazil should come up with a convincing economic recovery program. their comments echoed those of british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson, who met funaro yesterday. funaro is currently on a european trip seeking to involve governments in negotiations with commercial banks on rescheduling part of brazil's foreign debt, which totals some 109 billion dlrs. but lawson told funaro brazil had to solve its problems with the banks rather than governments. diplomatic sources in bonn said funaro would leave early tomorrow morning for zurich after meeting stoltenberg this evening. funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the imf and said there is no question of brazil agreeing to an austerity program with the fund. however, the west german banking sources said institutions here felt it was particularly important that brazil presented a credible recovery program and that there be a \"rapprochement\" with the imf. \"consultations are the least that can be expected,\" said one banker. funaro's trip follows the decision by brazil 10 days ago to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. it has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs. one senior banker closely involved in brazilian debt negotiation offered qualified support for a call from funaro for a change in the structure of the advisory committee of banks which has coordinated brazilian debt since 1982. funaro said yesterday that u.s. banks, holding 35 pct of brazilian debt, were over-represented on the 14-bank advisory committee with 50 pct of the committee seats. he said brazil might adopt a different approach to its creditor banks, involving separate discussions with the regions. such a move would be in brazil's interest, since european banks have been more supportive than u.s. banks of alternative debt solutions, such as interest capitalisation. the senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional approach, saying: \"there must be one committee and one solution.\" but he added: \"there must be an understanding that special requests from special regions be taken into account.\" german banks had objected to the fact that the idea of interest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. it was imperative that alternative options be considered. \"the menu must become richer,\" the banker said. banking sources said commercial banks would not be involved in today's talks with funaro. a spokesman for the bundesbank in frankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented. west german banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to the brazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions in the united states, because of their lower exposure. according to bundesbank data from september last year, west german bank exposure to latin america of slightly under 16 billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreign credit.

volcker term likely last week's white house shake-up has increased the odds that federal reserve board chairman paul volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the fed say. but they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this august, has been taken by the white house and volcker too has not made up his mind. former white house chief of staff donald regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator howard baker was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to volcker and tried often to undermine him. it is an open secret in washington that regan tried to ensure that volcker, first appointed in 1979 by president carter, will not be offered a third term by president reagan. only volcker's key allies in the reagan administration, vice-president george bush and treasury secretary james baker, kept regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said. sources close to the administration say regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that beryl sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace volcker. but as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire, it became clear that regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. the sources said new white house chief of staff howard baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the treasury department and is likely to respect his views on the fed chairmanship. as a moderate republican, baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to volcker. \"this new white house is going to need all the strength it can get,\" said one source when asked about the possibility of volcker's reappointment. paul volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the united states and around the world. at a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, volcker's departure would definitely undermine u.s. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say. u.s. officials say volcker works very closely with treasury secretary baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. the two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by volcker, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the treasury position. and a recent statement by a reagan administration official that the two men saw \"exactly eye-to-eye\" on the dollar was seen as an indication of baker's support for the fed chairman. baker is understood to have played a key role in volcker's reappointment to the fed in mid-1983. the sources said baker respects volcker and when appointed treasury secretary in february 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. regan, treasury secretary during president reagan's first term, was formerly head of wall street's largest brokerage firm merrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america's pre-eminent economic spokesman. he developed a deep antipathy for volcker, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much

volcker left this augsut, he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced fed boards in years. many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. an experienced successor, therefore, would seem a necessity. one widely mentioned possibility is secretary of state george shultz, whose experience as treasury secretary under preesident nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. but shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-iran scandal, while vice-chairman manuel johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. other potential candidates include economist alan greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic adviser, new york fed president e. gerald corrigan, federal deposit insurance corp chairman william seidman, and sprinkel. long a regan protege, sprinkel's

raises for salaried employees and is reducing the size of the merit raise pool to 3.5 pct of the total amount available for salaries from 5.5 pct last year, a company spokesman said. he said gm will no longer include merit raises in the calculation of base pay but will make them simply lump-sum payments. as a result, the merit raises will not be included in the calculation of pensions and other benefits. the change affects about 109,000 salaried workers in the u.s. and canada. gm last year eliminated cost of living increases for salaried workers, making pay increases based on merit alone. as a result of the new action, gm has effectively frozen the base pay rates of salaried employees. the spokesman said gm is making the change to remain cost-competitive with other u.s. automakers. gm is

around 120 cents within a few weeks,\" the roaster added. dutch coffee roasters' association secretary jan de vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer
